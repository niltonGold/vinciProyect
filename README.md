This is a simplified test to see whether you are ready to start learning modern web development

## Installation

1. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies in `package.json`
2. Run `yarn start` to host the website on http://localhost:3000.
4. Use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) on all files you edited before sending in your code test

## Tasks

1. **Update the template**

   Use this Figma file to update the template using Tailwind: https://www.figma.com/file/CecWOgBDDdkKzR3CymCXzV/Code-Test-Template?node-id=0%3A1&t=AEuBbQOQGUrh8iDP-1

2. **Emulate a fake sign in**

   When a user clicks on Sign in, execute the `getUser()` function to receive a user object. Then use the `toast()` function to notify the user he has signed in.

3. **Show your work**

   During the interview with VINCI, we will ask you to show your code and discuss your experience writing it.
